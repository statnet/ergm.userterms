Manuscript:
o As a reminder, please make sure that:
  - \proglang, \pkg and \code have been used for highlighting throughout
the paper (including titles and references), except where explicitly escaped.

RESP>> I did find one instance of \code that should have been \pkg and changed it.  I didn't see any other incorrect cases and hope I didn't overlook any.  There are some cases, like the use of \code{R} to refer to the subdirectory called R rather than the R program itself, that seem slightly borderline, so I hope we made the right call on those.

o In all cases, code input/output must fit within the normal textwidth of
the manuscript. Thus, code input should have appropriate line breaks and
code output should preferably be generated with a suitable width (or
otherwise edited).
	o pages 19-21 (see FAQ on "How should code be formatted in the 
	  manuscript").

RESP>> Fixed.

o Abbreviations should be spelled in upper-case letters without additional
formatting (i.e., without periods, without small caps, italics, etc.).
	o ERG models or ERGM <- should not be introduced with quotation 
	  marks.

RESP>> Done.

o When using "e.g." and "i.e." add a comma after the period to keep LaTeX
from interpreting them as the end of a sentence, i.e.: "e.g., " and 
"i.e., ".

RESP>> Done.

o All code comments (#) should be removed and incorporated within the text
of the manuscript.

RESP>> Done, mostly.  I am not sure how to handle two chunks of C code, the one nearest the bottom of p. 12 and the one nearest the top of p. 18, where the one-line comments indicate places within the code fragments where more code will later be inserted.  We feel this is a particularly useful summary of how this code should look and I don't see a good way to "incorporate within the text" this type of comment without detracting from readability.  Are these two examples permissible?

o Always capitalize the first word after a colon.

RESP>> Done, except in cases where \code{xxx} follows a colon.

o Figure placement (i.e. placement of floating objects): 
  The {figure} or {table} environment should be close to the first
  reference in the manuscript. It should first use the "t!" option for
  placement. If a figure then ends up before the start of its (sub)section,
  "t!" should be changed to "b!".  e.g., {figure}[b!].

RESP>> Done.

Code:
Please make sure that all files needed to replicate the code/any examples within the manuscript are included in a standalone replication script.

RESP>> There were no examples within the original manuscript except those that are purely illustrative of the syntax of particular commands, and all of the code that is excerpted in the manuscript is contained in the ergm and ergm.userterms packages.  Thus, we added a short section that illustrates the use of the package and included only this code in a standalone replication script (attached).
